Different lock modes control how transactions interact with each other when accessing the same data. This is essential to avoid anomalies like lost updates, dirty reads, or phantom reads. Lock modes define how much of the database is locked during a transaction and the impact on other transactions.</p>"},{"location":"technical-topics/example/#table-of-contents","title":"Table of Contents","text":"<ul> <li>What Are Lock Modes?</li> <li>Overview of Lock Types</li> <li>Lock Modes in PostgreSQL</li> <li>Lock Modes in JPA</li> <li>Pessimistic Locks<ul> <li>Pessimistic Read</li> <li>Pessimistic Write</li> </ul> </li> <li>Optimistic Locks<ul> <li>Optimistic Locking</li> <li>Optimistic Locking with Increment</li> </ul> </li> <li>How Lock Modes Affect Concurrency</li> <li>Choosing the Right Lock Mode</li> </ul>"},{"location":"technical-topics/example/#what-are-lock-modes","title":"What Are Lock Modes?","text":"<p>Lock modes define how database rows, tables, or other resources are locked during a transaction.
